    "# Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a statistical procedure used to determine if a sample data set provides sufficient evidence to reject a stated null hypothesis ($H_0$) in favor of an alternative hypothesis ($H_1$). This method is fundamental in science for drawing inferences about populations based on sample data. It allows researchers to make data-driven decisions and evaluate the likelihood that their observations are due to random chance or a genuine effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Statistical hypothesis test\n",
    "\n",
    "### Null Hypothesis ($H_0$) and Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$)\n",
    "\n",
    "In hypothesis testing, we begin by stating two competing hypotheses about population or a set of populations:\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**: This is a statement suggesting there is no effect, relationship, or difference. It represents the status quo or a baseline assumption. For example, in a clinical trial, $H_0$ might state that a new drug has no effect compared to a placebo (i.e. the patients in placebo population are not different than the one in the population of treated patients).\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$)**: This hypothesis reflects what the researcher aims to prove. It suggests that there is an effect, a relationship, or a difference. In the clinical trial example, $H_1$ would state that the new drug has a beneficial effect compared to the placebo.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of hypothesis testing is to assess whether the data provides enough evidence to reject $H_0$ in favor of $H_1$. This process involves comparing the observed data in a sample to what we would expect under $H_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "A **test statistic** is a value calculated from sample data that allows us to make a decision about the hypotheses. One commonly used test statistic is the **difference in means** between two samples. For example, if we want to compare the average effect of a treatment versus a placebo, we calculate the difference in the sample means for the two groups. The test statistic helps determine how far the observed data deviates from what we would expect under $H_0$, which typically assumes that there is no difference in means between the groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling Distribution under the Null Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "The **sampling distribution under the null hypothesis** is the distribution of the test statistic assuming that $H_0$ is true. This distribution helps us understand the range of possible values the test statistic can take if the null hypothesis is correct. By comparing the observed test statistic to this distribution, we can determine how likely it is to observe such a value by random chance alone. This comparison is essential for calculating the *p* value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## $p$ value\n",
    "\n",
    "The **$p$ value** represents the probability of obtaining the observed data, or something more extreme, if the null hypothesis were true. It is used as a measure of evidence against $H_0$:\n",
    "- A smaller $p$ value suggests that the observed data would be unlikely under $H_0$, providing stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.\n",
    "- For example, a $p$ value of 0.03 means there is a 3% chance of observing the data (or something more extreme) if $H_0$ is true. This small probability indicates that the data is not consistent with $H_0$, leading us to consider rejecting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Significance Level ($\\alpha$)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **significance level** (denoted as $\\alpha$) is a predetermined threshold that determines whether the *p* value is considered small enough to reject the null hypothesis. A common choice for $\\alpha$ is 0.05, which means we are willing to accept a 5% chance of incorrectly rejecting $H_0$ (Type I error):\n",
    "- If the *p* value is less than $\\alpha$, the results are considered **statistically significant**, and we reject $H_0$.\n",
    "- The choice of $\\alpha$ depends on the context of the study and the consequences of making an error. For example, in medical research, a smaller $\\alpha$ (e.g., 0.01) might be chosen to reduce the risk of false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### False Positives and False Negatives\n",
    "\n",
    "In hypothesis testing, two types of errors can occur:\n",
    "- **False Positive (Type I Error)**: Rejecting $H_0$ when it is actually true. This error can lead to incorrect conclusions, such as believing a treatment is effective when it is not.\n",
    "- **False Negative (Type II Error)**: Failing to reject $H_0$ when the alternative hypothesis is true. This error can result in missed discoveries, such as failing to detect a real effect or relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "The balance between Type I and Type II errors is crucial in hypothesis testing. Researchers often need to consider the trade-offs between these errors when designing studies and choosing significance levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations & Misinterpretations\n",
    "\n",
    "While hypothesis testing is powerful, it has its limitations and can be easily misinterpreted:\n",
    "- **$p$ values** provide the strength of evidence against $H_0$, but they do not indicate the size of the effect or its practical significance. A small $p$ value might suggest a statistically significant result, but the actual effect size could be trivial.\n",
    "- A **$p$ value** does not give the probability that either hypothesis is true. It only tells us how compatible the observed data is with $H_0$.\n",
    "- Results can be **statistically significant** without being **practically significant**, and vice versa. Thus, it is crucial to interpret the results in the context of the research question and the real-world implications. For instance, a medical treatment might show a statistically significant improvement, but the actual benefit to patients might be minimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assessing Significance Using Permutation Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use **permutation testing** to evaluate significance. This approach involves creating a **null distribution** by permuting the dependent variable (the target) and calculating the corresponding loss values. We then compare the observed loss to this distribution to compute a **$p$ value**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Permutation Testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Permutation testing is non-parametric, meaning it doesnâ€™t assume a specific distribution of the residuals or the coefficients. This makes it a powerful and flexible method, especially in cases where the assumptions of parametric tests (e.g., normality) might not hold. Further, we here use it as a pedagogic tool, to understand how frequentist hypothesis testing actually works.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Permutation Testing for Model Significance\n",
    "\n",
    "In permutation testing, we test the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between the dependent and independent variables. To do this, we randomly shuffle the dependent variable **y** while keeping the independent variable **x** unchanged, refit the model, and compute the loss. Repeating this process many times creates a **null distribution** of losses. The $p$ value is calculated by comparing the observed loss to this null distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-step Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fit the model** on the original data and calculate the observed loss.\n",
    "2. **Permute** the dependent variable (shuffle **y**) and refit the model on the permuted data to calculate the loss under the null hypothesis.\n",
    "3. **Repeat** the permutation process many times to build a distribution of losses under the null hypothesis.\n",
    "4. Calculate the **$p$ value** by comparing the observed loss to this distribution.\n",
    "\n",

Note that we have not corrected for multiple testing when performing these tests, something we will discuss in a separate chapter (and lecture)."
